# Train test Algorithm test harness
# Description:
# - The train_test is a method that is used to evaluate a machine learning algorithm
# Assumptions:
# - Function to split dataset into training and testing datasets
# - Function to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm's predictions
# Objectives:
# - Consume dataset, and an algorithm
# - Evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm's predictions by returning a performance score

# def train_test(self, dataset, algorithm, split, *args):
